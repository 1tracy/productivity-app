A Productivity App
Coded By Helen Xia and Tracy Dong

What Inspired Us Over the quarantine, my friends and I have all struggled with keeping up with schoolwork and setting deadlines for due work. It often became overwhelming to decide on which classes and assignments to focus on first. As a result, for this hackathon, our team decided to create a productivity app that would create a schedule for you, such that you accomplish the most important tasks first and maximize your productivity.

What We Learned In this project, the two main components were the interactive Tkinter interface, as well as the back-end where we used the Scheduling Algorithm to determine which tasks were the most important and quickest to complete. Over the course of this hackathon, we explored the various Tkinter functions, as well as experimented with different ways to manipulate user data.

Challenges We Faced Since this was our first hackathon as high school students only experienced in Python, it was challenging to come up and produce an application that would help people in their day-to-day lives while still being able to complete the project within the given time frame. This hackathon has taught us a lot about the importance of staying organized and clear communication when collaborating together and has really sparked our interest in attending more hackathons in the future.
